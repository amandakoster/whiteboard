You have an integer array which contains numbers from 1 to 100 but one number is missing, you need to write a function `calculateMissing = (array) => {...}` to find that missing number in an array.

```javascript

```
* One trick to solve this problem is to calculate sum of all numbers in the array and compare with expected sum, the difference would be the missing number.
